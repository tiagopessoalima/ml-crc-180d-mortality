# ml-crc-180d-mortality
This repository contains experiments to predict 180-day mortality in older CRC patients (≥60 years, IMIP, 2015–2022) using ML models. The data, collected at admission, undergoes normalization, imputation, and class balancing. Models are optimized with Bayesian methods and evaluated using G-Mean and Wilcoxon test.
